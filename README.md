# music-equilizer-and-generator
A desktop application with two functions : music equalizer and synthetic music generator

We created a GUI using tkinter python consisting of two tabs:\
[A] Music Equalizer : an equalizer that can manipulate music by analyzing the audio signal in frequency domain, it supports the following features:\
1.Import wav file from device\
2.Control volume\
3.Pause and Resume the audio signal\
4.Control specific volume for 5 different instruments in music file (Guitar,Xylophone,Piano,Saxophone, and Drums)\
5.Display Signal in time domain (automatically following and displaying user changes in equalizer sliders)\
6.Display frequency spectrum of the file (automatically following and displaying user changes in equalizer sliders)\
7.Display signal spectrogram

[B] Music Generator: Virtual Instruments that let the user play three different instruments that generate synthetic sounds, It supports the following features:\
1.Choose desired Instrument (Bongo,PanFlute, and Xylophone)\
